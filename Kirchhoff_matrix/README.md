# Tasks

- Build and diagonalize the Kirchoff matrix.
- What are the physical units of the eigenvalues? and the eigenvectors?
- Could you predict the value of the CA's B factors from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors? If you
  do so, could you compare the experimental values found in the PDB file with the theoretical ones
  -coming from the GNM-?
- Could you compute the correlation matrix $\<\Delta Ri \cdot \Delta Rj\>$? Once you have it,
  please represent graphically the correlation matrix as a 2D map with a red-white-blue colorbar to
  show the value of its elements.
- What does the mode associated with the lowes eigenvalue mean? and its eigenvalue?
- With the assistance of mdtraj and nglview, show in your notebook the cartoon or
  ribbon representation of the protein. Could you give a color to each residue according to:
     - The $\<\Delta Ri \cdot \Delta Ri\>$ of each CA from the GNM.
     - The value of the elements of the i-th eigenvector (one value per CA).
