# To DO
- What's a Langevin dynamics?
- What's the dissipative term of the Langevin dynamics for? And the flucuation term?
- Is there a relationship the dissipation and fluctuation have to accomplish? What happens if we
  dissipate more than "fluctuate"... what happens if we "fluctuate" more than dissipate?
- What happens if the damping (friction) is cero and the temperatura is cero?
- What happens if the damping (friction) is not cero and the temperatura is cero?
- What happens if the damping (friction) is cero and the temperatura is not cero?
- What happens if the damping (friction) is not cero and the temperatura is not cero?
- Could you calculate, by hand, the mean expected kinetic energy of your brownian particle? Does
  your result match with the average kinetic energy obtained from a long enough trajectory?
